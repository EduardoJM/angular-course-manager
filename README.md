# Angular Course Manager (Basic CRUD)

This is my first project using Angular and it's a basic **CRUD** (**Create**, **Retrieve**, **Update**, **Delete**), using **Angular**. This project was created during the course **Introdução ao Angular 8** on the **Santander Bootcamp | FullStack Developer** in the **Digital Innovation One** platform. The project uses **Bootstrap** and **FontAwesome** for styles and icons.

The **Back-end** of this project was a mock api using **json-server** package and the initial data is found on the **db.json** file at root of the project path.
